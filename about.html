                    <p>Capstone has been designing and manufacturing garments since 1854. From the part we played in the development of unisex workwear at the start of the 20th Century, right through to the development of modern protective workwear and suiting for just about every sector and business in the UK, to the solutions we now offer to millions of wearers across the world, Capstone has remained true to our core principles - quality, good design and reliable service. 
                        The award of The Royal Warrant is testament to our continued commitment to workwear development, at the very highest level.</p>
